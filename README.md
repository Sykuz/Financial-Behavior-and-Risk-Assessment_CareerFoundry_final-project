# Financial-Behavior-and-Risk-Assessment_CareerFoundry_final-project
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks from my Achievement 6 at CareerFoundry, the Final Project.

###Introduction
This project explores synthetic credit card transaction data generated by IBM to analyze consumer spending behavior and develop user risk profiles with a geospatial perspective. Using demographic, financial, and transaction-level data, the analysis examines how factors such as income, debt, FICO score, and card usage patterns influence spending across regions. Exploratory analysis highlights key relationships between financial variables and spending activity, while geospatial analysis maps transaction volumes and fraud hotspots across U.S. states. Regression models are applied to measure the impact of financial characteristics on spending behavior, and clustering techniques are used to segment users into distinct risk groups. A time-series analysis adds further insight into transaction trends and fraud activity over time. Together, these methods provide a comprehensive view of consumer risk and spending behavior, while demonstrating practical applications of geospatial and predictive analytics in the financial services context.
