# Credit-Card-Financial-Behavior_CareerFoundry_final-project
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks from my Achievement 6 at CareerFoundry, the Final Project.

## Introduction
This project explores synthetic credit card transaction data generated by IBM to analyze consumer spending behavior and develop user risk profiles with a geospatial perspective. Using demographic, financial, and transaction-level data, the analysis examines how factors such as income, debt, FICO score, and card usage patterns influence spending across regions. Exploratory analysis highlights key relationships between financial variables and spending activity, while geospatial analysis maps transaction volumes across U.S. states. Regression models are applied to measure the impact of financial characteristics on spending behavior, and clustering techniques are used to segment users into distinct risk groups. A time-series analysis adds further insight into transaction trends and fraud activity over time. Together, these methods provide a comprehensive view of consumer spending behavior, while demonstrating practical applications of geospatial and predictive analytics in the financial services context.

## Objectives and Goals
To illustrate how credit card spending has evolved over time as adoption has increased. It examines trends in total spending growth, average purchase value, and category preferences to reveal shifts in consumer behavior year by year. The goal is to highlight key spending patterns and provide actionable insights to help financial institutions better understand customer habits, identify growth opportunities, and design data-driven strategies for credit card products.
